# Single-Cycle-RISC-V-Processor
Th repository contains a Verilog implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V processor core. The design supports a subset of the RV32I base instruction set, making it suitable for educational purposes and as a foundation for more complex processor designs.

# Key Features
* Implements core RV32I instructions (arithmetic, logical, memory, control flow)

* Single-cycle execution model (one instruction per clock cycle)

* 32-bit architecture with 32 general-purpose registers

* Basic memory interface for instruction and data access

* Simple control unit and ALU design

# Note
Copy all the modules including the Top Module in your IDE to see the functionality by simulation.
